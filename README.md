## This is my basic calculator project
It can execute the basic operations. <br/>
On the screen the numbers are displayed up to 11 digits, above that it gives you an error. <br/> 
Aim: work with components, create a component (Button) and reuse it in different components (NumberButtons and OperatorButtons) with different purpose.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### npm run dev
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open Local: http://localhost:5173/number_to_word/ to view it in your browser.
